## 'I am really scared': Family lost in corn maze calls 911 for help

If a Massachusetts family says they got the Halloween scare of a lifetime by getting lost inside a dark and creepy Salem-area corn maze and had to call 911 for rescue, believe them.

A Massachusetts family got the Halloween scare of a lifetime by getting lost inside a dark and creepy Salem-area corn maze and had to call 911 for rescue.
Danvers police say they got a call of distress from a mother of two about 6:32 p.m. Monday. The woman alerted the 911 operator of their situation in the Connors Farm in Danvers, a short distance from Salem.
A voice recording of the 911 call was made available to the media on Wednesday. The exchange:

Woman: "Hi, I just called. I'm still stuck at Connors Farms. I don't see anybody. I am really scared. It's really dark and we've got a 3-week-old baby with us."

Dispatcher: "Just relax. Calm down. Your husband is with you right?"

Woman: "Yes, but my baby?"

Dispatcher: "OK. I understand and the police officer is on the way."

Woman: "We thought this would be fun. Instead it's a nightmare. I don't know what made us do this. It was daytime when we came in. And I never take my daughter out. This is the first time. Never again."

The family's harrowing journey was first reported by The Danvers Herald and picked up nationwide.

Farm owner Bob Connors said Wednesday his maze on seven acres was created so that people would get lost in its towering stalks. The maze, in the shape of a headless horseman with the words "Salem Village" and "Danvers, Ma." carved out, can take up to an hour to navigate, Connors told msnbc.com.

Connors said it was a busy day and he left the farm and his farm manager about 6:20 p.m. Monday, only to return a short time later. Connors said he received a phone call from a friend who told him about police squad cars at the family farm at 30 Valley Road.

“People like to take their time and we don’t like to rush people out of the maze," Connors said. "We like to give people their money’s worth."
He said a Danvers police with a tracking dog quickly plunged into the depths of the maze with a farm manager to search for the disoriented dad, mom and two young kids.

Within a minute or so upon arrival, the police officer located the family. The family didn't realize they had almost made their way out; they were just 25 feet from the street, Connors said.

"Usually we see smiles coming out of the maze," he said. "I could understand the family's concern, because they had a little one with them. And I’m sure they won’t be the last family who gets lost in there.”

Said Connors: "I have a funny feeling it's going to be a real busy season."
