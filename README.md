# ROAM

Created by music artists Deafbrick (Brazil/UK), Duma (Kenya) and Simon Grab (Switzerland) and with visuals and coding from Genesys (Brazil), Roam is a meta-labyrinth: a first person 3D game shaped maze composed of approximately 50 references of labyrinths taken from cinema, poetry, visual arts, philosophy, society, popular culture and mythology. The goal is to find the artists' music scattered and hidden in the game's architecture. And to get lost.
